Runtime dependencies of Waver

All this is for Ubuntu Linux, other platforms are not yet supported.

Please note that you only have to mess with these requirements if you 
build Waver yourself from source code. If you install from a ppa or 
a .deb package, then all of these will be solved for you automatically.

I will leave the Qt stuff to the end, because that's pretty common.
So let's start with the more Waver-specific things.

1. GStreamer

Waver's Generic Decoder plugin uses Qt's QAudioDecoder class, which
in turn uses GStreamer on Ubuntu. However, GStreamer requires some
plugins for this work. You'll need:

gstreamer0.10
gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg


2. TagLib




3. Qt 5.7

If your Ubuntu distribution does not come with the Qt 5.7 runtime,
then you'll have to supply the required libs and packages. This is
most easily done by installing Qt 5.7 from https://www.qt.io/qt5-7/
and then setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the correct location.
