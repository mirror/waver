Waver currently uses Qt version 5.7

Please note that even though the source contains some platform-specific code, 
Waver is currently being developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux only!

How to build:

1. qmake --version

should produce an output similar to this:

    QMake version 3.0
    Using Qt version 5.7.0 in <path_to_qt_lib>

You can download Qt 5.7 at https://www.qt.io/qt5-7/

Please note that you might have multiple versions of QMake on your system. 
For example, you might have to pinpoint the correct QMake by like this: 
~/Qt/5.7/gcc_64/bin/qmake


2. cd to the branch


3. qmake waver_all.pro

Again, make sure you launch the correct QMake, so prefix it with the path if 
needed.


4. make


5. If you want to run Waver:

Do not use 'make install', it's not working yet.

First make sure you have all the runtime dependencies.
See DEPS_RT for more info.

Then do the following:

    mkdir ~/waver_rt
    cp waver/waver ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_equalizer/libwp_equalizer.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_genericdecoder/libwp_genericdecoder.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_localsource/libwp_localsource.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_radiosource/libwp_radiosource.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_soundoutput/libwp_soundoutput.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    cp wp_taglibinfo/libwp_taglibinfo.so.1.0.0 ~/waver_rt/
    ~/waver_rt/waver


6. To reset your branch:

    make clean
    bzr clean-tree
